				Again, Oscars weekend has arrived, and this year I made an effort to watch many of this years nominations. I was able to see 35 of the 52 nominated films (67%) including all of the best picture nominees. I watched many great films I never would have seen if they weren't nominated, and others I wish I wouldn't have seen at all. With that being said, I wanted to chose the winners as if I were the Academy. These are my personal opinions, not who I think will win. My personal picks for the 91st Academy awards are as follows:
			</p>
			<div class="review-container">
				<h2>Best Picture – The Favourite</h2>
				<p>
					This is the second year I had the opportunity to see all of the nominees in this category. Unfortunately, I thought this year was one of the weakest in recent history. The nominees felt like a mixed bag; some great some not so great. Out of all the films nominated my personal favorite was <i>The Favourite</i>. This period piece, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, told a contemporary story set in the Victorian Era. With a fantastic story, great ensemble, and beautiful cinematography, this film is my personal choice for best picture.
        </p>

				<h2>Lead Actress – Olivia Colman (The Favourite)</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see four out of the five nominations for Best Actress (Unfortunately I missed <i>Can you ever forgive Me?</i>). Olivia Colman is my personal choice, because I thought she gave an engaging preformance with a wide range of emotions. Yalitza Aparicio is a very close second.
				</p>

				<h2>Lead Actor – Christian Bale (Vice)</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see 4 of the five of the Lead Actor nominees this season. I missed Willem Dafoe's preformance in <i>At Eternity's Gate</i>. I thought the nominated preformances this year were weaker than in the past, but Bale did a great job transforming into Dick Cheney.
				</p>

				<h2>Supporting Actor – Adam Driver (BlackKKlansman)</h2>
				<p>
					Again, I missed out on <i>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</i>, but was able to see the other four nominees. Out of the four, my personal favorite was Adam Driver. I really enjoyed Sam Rockwell and Mahershala Ali's preformance, but for me Adam Driver was the most memorable out of all the supporting actor preformances.
        </p>

				<h2>Supporting Actress – Emma Stone (The Favourite)</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see all of the nominees for this category and I enjoyed all of the preformances. I was surprised to see Emma Stone in the supporting actress category, since her preformance felt more like a lead role, but never the less I thought she had the strongest preformance out of the nominees.
				</p>

				<h2>Director – Alfonso Cuarón (Roma)</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Roma</i> was a beautiful real story about a mexican domestic worker. Easily one of the best technical films of 2019, Cuarón not only creates a technical marvel, but brings out great preformances from actors with limited experience. He is easily my pick for best Director.
				</p>

				<h2>Animated Feature – Isle of Dogs</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see 4 out of the 5 nominees for best animated feature, and my personal favorite was Isle of Dogs. The stop motion animation had Wes Anderson's usual unnique style, and the story was fun and original. The other nominees felt much less original.
				</p>

				<h2>Original Screenplay – First Reformed</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see all 5 nominees for this category. My personal choice is <i>First Reformed</i>, a timely story that has an interesting message and great characters. Paul Schrader again, delivers a superb script.
				</p>

				<h2>Adapted Screenplay – BlackKKlansman</h2>
				<p>
					Spike Lee has had a huge impact on cinema, and what better way to award him with an award for <i>BlackKKlansman's</i> great Screenplay. Part comedy part drama, <i>BlackKKlansman</i> does an excellent job keeping a balanced tone and tells an impactful timely story.
				</p>

				<h2>Cinematography – Roma</h2>
				<p>
					Early into the Oscar Season I thought for sure that <i>First Man</i> was a lock for this win, but since then <i>Roma</i> wowed me with its breathtaking cinematography.
				</p>

				<h2>Documentary Feature – Minding The Gap</h2>
				<p>
					I was only able to see 3 out of the 5 nominees, and enjoyed all of them. However, none of the other documenaries touched me emotionally as much as <i>Minding the Gap</i>. I would highly recommend this film.
				</p>

				<h2>Foreign Language Film – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					Sadly, I was only able to see Roma and Shoplifters so I cannot pick a clear winner, however I absolutely loved Shoplifters. It was one of my favorite films of the year.
				</p>

				<h2>Documentary Short – End Game</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see all of these nominees in the theatre. This years nominees felt much weaker than last, but End Game stood out to me as the best this year. It is an emotionally hard film to watch. It's tough subject matter is very sad, but allowed me to think about death in a different way after viewing.
				</p>
				<h2>Live Action Short – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					Sadly, I wasn't able to see any of these films. This has always been an infamously hard category to watch and this year was no different.
				</p>
				<h2>Animated Short – Weekends</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see all of the short animated films this year. I enjoyed all of these films, but it came down to <i>Bao</i> and <i>Weekends</i>. Both had original stories and great messages, but I thought the art style of <i>Weekends</i> was just more unique and that's why its my personal choice.
				</p>
				<h2>Film Editing – The Favourite</h2>
				<p>
					This category is hard for me since good editing usually goes unnoticed in a film. <i>Dunkirk</i> That being said, I thought the pacing in <i>The Favourite</i> was great and some of the transitions were noticeably well done.
				</p>
				<h2>Sound Editing – A Quiet Place</h2>
				<p>
					This one seems like a no-brainer to me. The star of <i>A Quiet place</i> was the sound. The lack of sound and the quiet noices that were much more noticable really make this films sound stand out.
				</p>
				<h2>Sound Mixing – Bohemian Rhapsody</h2>
				<p>
					I wasn't a big fan of this film, but reading about the sound mixing that went into creating some of the concert scenes was impressive. This gets my vote.
				</p>
				<h2>Production Design – The Favourite</h2>
				<p>
					The sets in <i>The Favourite</i> were beautiful. Of course victorian period pieces often have wonderful sets, but there was something about the castle in this film that felt so beautiful and interesting to look at.
				</p>
				<h2>Original Score – If Beale Street Could Talk</h2>
				<p>
					I was really upset to see <i>First Man's</i> score miss out on a nomination. The rest of the nominees felt a bit weak to me besides <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>. The score really helped elevate the emotional moments in the film nicely.
				</p>
				<h2>Original Song – "When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings"</h2>
				<p>
					I love Shallow, and that song will win, but I am a sucker for old western country songs, and that's exactly what "When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings" is from <i>The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</i>. I still catch myself singing it after watching the film.
				</p>
				<h2>Makeup and Hair – Vice</h2>
				<p>
					This seems like an easy pick this year. Bale transforms himself again with the help of some amazing oscar-worthy makeup.
				</p>
				<h2>Costume Design – Black Panther</h2>
				<p>
					I wasn't the biggest fan of this film, but the one thing that did stand out to me was the costume design. This film also had the most unique costumes out of all the other nominees.
				</p>
				<h2>Visual Effects – Ready Player One</h2>
				<p>
					It was between this film and Infinity War, but I just enjoyed the world that the effects created in <i>Ready Player One</i> more.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p class="review-bottom">
				Those are my opinions on who I think deserves the win for each Oscar category. After crunching the numbers, <i>The Favourite</i> was my most picked with 5 winners. After that Roma, Vice, and BlackKKlansman all got 2 wins. As you can see <i>The Favourite</i> was one of my favorite films of the year (no pun intended). I am very excited for the 91st Academy Awards tonight, and I hope everyone has a fun time watching. Happy Oscars!
