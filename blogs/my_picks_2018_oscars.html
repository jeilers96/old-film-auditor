				The 90th Academy Awards are finally here, and after watching 30 out of the 59 films (over 50%!) I am proud to say that this is the most successful I have been in watching so many of the nominees before the ceremony. Since I have seen so many of the films I thought I would make a post that discussed what winners I would chose in each category as long as I have seen the majority of the films. This is not a list of the films that I think are going to win, it is just my opinion on who should win. Here are my winners for the 90th Academy Awards:
			</p>
			<div class="review-container">
				<h2>Best Picture – Phantom Thread</h2>
				<p>
					This is the First year I got the opportunity to see all nine of the nominees in this category. There was a lot of tough competition, but <i>Phantom Thread</i> enchanted me the most. It was the combination of the soundtrack, cinematography, Daniel Day-Lewis' Acting, and the overall story that makes <i>Phantom Thread</i> my choice for Best Picture.
				</p>

				<h2>Lead Actress – Frances McDormand</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see four out of the five nominations for Best Actress. The only film I missed was <i>I, Tonya</i>, which I was very disappointed I missed. Frances McDormand is my pick because her performance was the most captivating, and I loved her character.
				</p>

				<h2>Lead Actor – Daniel Day-Lewis</h2>
				<p>
					I was able to see all five of the Lead Actress nominees this season. I enjoyed all of the performances in this category, but I thought that Daniel Day-Lewis' supposed final acting role was phenomenal. He was the star of that film, forcing you to stay invested in his character the entire film.
				</p>

				<h2>Supporting Actor – Sam Rockwell</h2>
				<p>
					I missed <i>All of the Money in the World</i> this season, but I did see the other four nominations. Out of the four that I saw it was hard for me to choose between Willem Defoe and Sam Rockwell. For me Sam's role was slightly more interesting and so I chose Rockwell as the winner.
				</p>

				<h2>Supporting Actress – Octavia Spencer</h2>
				<p>
					Octavia Spencer was one of my favorite parts of <i>The Shape of Water</i>. Out of the four nominations I saw in this category, she was the one that was the most entertaining. A close second would be Laurie Metcalf from <i>Lady Bird</i>.
				</p>

				<h2>Director – Guillermo del Toro</h2>
				<p>
					<i>The Shape of Water</i> was a beautiful cross genre film that I thought was executed extremely well, making it easy to chose del Toro as my winner. I really enjoyed the other nominees work, but del Toro deserves to be awarded for this enjoyable film.
				</p>

				<h2>Animated Feature – Loving Vincent</h2>
				<p>
					The only reason I am giving the win to <i>Loving Vincent</i> is because I haven't seen <i>Coco yet</i>, which I hope to see soon. I did not love <i>Loving Vincent</i>, but the animation was absolutely breathtaking. That's why it beats out <i>Boss Baby</i> and <i>The Breadwinner</i>.
				</p>

				<h2>Original Screenplay – Get Out</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Get Out</i> was one of the most creative and important films of 2017 and that's why it was an easy choice for best Original Screenplay.
				</p>

				<h2>Adapted Screenplay – Mudbound</h2>
				<p>
					<i>Mudbound</i> was one of the best films of the year. Out of the four films that I saw in this category it was my personal favorite and I thought the story seemed put together exceptionally well.
				</p>

				<h2>Cinematography – The Shape of Water</h2>
				<p>
					I loved the way the camera was utilized in the shape of water. The opening credit sequence was particullary enjoyable for me. I think that if I had seen <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> I would have picked that, but <i>The Shape of Water</i> was still a beautifully shot film.
				</p>

				<h2>Documentary Feature – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					I was only able to watch <i>Strong Island</i>, which I was not the biggest fan of. I wish I would have time to watch <i>Icarus</i> and <i>the Last Men in Aleppo</i>, but to be honest the feature documenaries were not the highest of priorities.
				</p>

				<h2>Foreign Language Film – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					Sadly, I was unable to watch any of the Foreign Language features mostly because I didn't have access to them, and I also ran out of time (dang homework).
				</p>

				<h2>Documentary Short – Knife Skills</h2>
				<p>
					Out of all of the categories this year, this one was surprisingly one of my favorites to watch. I really enjoyed all of the documentaries in this category particularly <i>Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405</i> and <i>Knife Skills</i>. I had to give the win to <i>Knife Skills</i> however because I thought the film's message was a bit more interesting.
				</p>
				<h2>Live Action Short – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					Sadly, I wasn't able to see any of these films. This has always been an infamously hard category to watch and this year was no different.
				</p>
				<h2>Animated Short – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					I only got that chance to see <i>Dear Basketball</i> and <i>Revolting Rhymes</i>, both of which I enjoyed. Unfortunately I didn't see enough of the nominations to pick a fair winner.
				</p>
				<h2>Film Editing – Dunkirk</h2>
				<p>
					This category is hard for me since good editing usually goes unnoticed in a film. <i>Dunkirk</i> however did a really good job of balancing and intertwining the three different time sequences, which I think makes the film deserving of best Film Editing.
				</p>
				<h2>Sound Editing – Dunkirk</h2>
				<p>
					One of the things I said when I left the theatre after seeing <i>Dunkirk</i> this summer was how amazing the sound was and that I bet it will win best sound Editing. Well I hope this comes true because I thought that this film's sound was astounding.
				</p>
				<h2>Sound Mixing – Dunkirk</h2>
				<p>
					Same as above basically. The sound effects and the usage of sound in <i>Dunkirk</i> were one of the films best qualities. I could possibly be persuaded to pick <i>Baby Driver</i> since syncing music to an action sequence was awesome.
				</p>
				<h2>Production Design – The Shape of Water</h2>
				<p>
					The sets in <i>The Shape of Water</i> were beautiful and unique. Del Toro's films always have a certain whimsical art style associated with them, and this film was no exception.
				</p>
				<h2>Original Score – Phantom Thread</h2>
				<p>
					Jonny Greenwood's score in <i>Phantom Thread</i> was beautiful. I would love to give my pick to John Williams because I love that man, but I thought that the score in <i>Phantom Thread</i> really elevated my viewing experience.
				</p>
				<h2>Original Song – Not Enough Seen</h2>
				<p>
					One of my least favorite categories and I only saw two of the nominations, and even after watching them I couldn't tell you what either original song sounded like.
				</p>
				<h2>Makeup and Hair – Darkest Hour</h2>
				<p>
					This is an easy pick. If you can transform Gary Oldman into Winston Churchill, then I think you deserve an Oscar.
				</p>
				<h2>Costume Design – Phantom Thread</h2>
				<p>
					The film about designing dresses is an easy pick for best Costume Design. The dresses in the film are also beautiful and unique making it an even easier choice.
				</p>
				<h2>Visual Effects – Star Wars: The Last Jedi</h2>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the two front runners in this category: <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> and <i>War for the Planet of the Apes</i>. Out of the three nominations I saw, the most visually pleasing film was Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
				</p>
