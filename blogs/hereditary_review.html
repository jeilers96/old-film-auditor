          Many "horror" films released today attempt to scare audiences by utilizing jump scares that startle the audience for all of 5 seconds. This makes for many of these films to be forgetful since none of the actual imagery or characters are scary, just startling. <i>Hereditary</i> avoids this formula, opting for a much more developed horror story that will stick with audiences long after they leave the theatre.
      </p>
      <p>
          This film lingers in the mind because of a few strong elements that many other modern horror films lack. The first thing that stood out was the slow buildup of the story. The film takes time to develop its characters and build suspense and disbelief. The first act of the film takes the time to develop the backstory and motivations behind the main character, Annie, played by Toni Collate. This helps the viewer grow a connection to Annie, making them more invested as they witness her family spiral into madness.

          Another aspect of the film that adds to the horror is the acting. Toni Collate in particular delivers an amazing performance as a mother that is driven to insanity. There are many moments in which her character breaks down, and she captures that raw emotion flawlessly. Collate is also surrounded by other great performances from Alex Wolff and a debut from Milly Shapiro who is creepy as hell. All of these performances make the film much more believable, adding to the creepiness of this film.

          In addition to the acting, the camera work heightens the film's horrifying feel. Instead of the usual quick cuts and crazy camera movements, that many horror movies have, this film goes in the exact opposite direction. The camera lingers on horrifying or uncomfortable imagery slowly panning or zooming. This made me feel as though I was forced to watch. Much like a horrific car accident, all you want to do is look away but you cannot because the camera work draws you in.
      </p>

        Overall, this film feels like a horror film from 40 years ago void of jump scares and full of emotional and psychological horror. One small complaint I have about this film is that the ending feels a bit on the nose, trying to explain things it didn't need to. Never the less, this film is one of the best horror films in recent memory. There are still some horrendous scenes I can't get out of my mind.
